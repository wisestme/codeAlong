		<a name="lorem" title="text place3 holder"><h3>Lorem Ipsum</h3></a>
		<p>
		The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
	</p>
	<p>
		The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.

		Greatness
	</h3>
	<p>
		No doubt, you must have attended seminars on how to become great or you have listened to some preachers discuss on the subject or you probably have read a book on becoming great. Whatever has formed the bedrock of your thought on greatness, I hereby bring you to the last bus stop on thoughts on greatness. The simplest way to greatness:
		Some say; some are born great, others say; no man is born great, greatness is achieved. all wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		God created all of us. And He didn't create anyone of us without a purpose. And if we can fulfil whatever purpose we were created for, then our greatness will show. Therefore, greatness is not achieved. It dwells on the inside of everyman. we were all born great just that some of us don't allow our greatness to manifest. And please note here that greatness has nothing to do with how much money you have though it might just be an infinitesimal part of it. Because the greatest man of all time was poor that you might be rich. The first step to the manifestation of your greatness is to be united with Jesus Christ.
	</p>
	<p>
		He is the greatest man of all time, He had it in His power to be rich yet He was poor so you might be rich. what does that tell you? Greatness must have something to do with sacrifice. yes! its your right, you have the ability to get it but you can give it up for someone else. that is greatness. Greatness is directly proportional to sacrifice.
	</p>
	<p>
		.... "and I will make your name great". God's promise to Abraham. Abraham had to leave everything he had for God to make his name great.
