		The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

	<h3>
		Greatness
	</h3>
	<p>
		No doubt, you must have attended seminars on how to become great or you have listened to some preachers discuss on the subject or you probably have read a book on becoming great. Whatever has formed the bedrock of your thought on greatness, I hereby bring you to the last bus stop on thoughts on greatness. The simplest way to greatness:
		Some say; some are born great, others say; no man is born great, greatness is achieved. all wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		God created all of us. And He didn't create anyone of us without a purpose. And if we can fulfil whatever purpose we were created for, then our greatness will show. Therefore, greatness is not achieved. It dwells on the inside of everyman. we were all born great just that some of us don't allow our greatness to manifest. And please note here that greatness has nothing to do with how much money you have though it might just be an infinitesimal part of it. Because the greatest man of all time was poor that you might be rich. The first step to the manifestation of your greatness is to be united with Jesus Christ.
	</p>
	<p>
		He is the greatest man of all time, He had it in His power to be rich yet He was poor so you might be rich. what does that tell you? Greatness must have something to do with sacrifice. yes! its your right, you have the ability to get it but you can give it up for someone else. that is greatness. Greatness is directly proportional to sacrifice.
	</p>
	<p>
		.... "and I will make your name great". God's promise to Abraham. Abraham had to leave everything he had for God to make his name great.

		Letter to Ralph
	</h3></a>
	<p><a name="top"></a>Ralph, in your advocacy for Olumba as the Christ, you tried to claim that the name of Jesus has changed and your scriptural proof was Phil2:9 which says; "Wherefore, God hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name."

<p>So you now imagine that Jesus is back with another name and you believe that the new name is Olumba. No, it is not so. You dont have to go far to see that the name of Jesus has not changed. Right in that same portion you quoted, just read the next verse,
</p>

<h4>Phil2:10.</h4><p>It says; 
That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow,of things in heaven and the things in earth and things under the earth."
</p>

Also look at the next verse again, 
<br />Phil2:11.
<br /> It says "And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." So it is clear even for a theological novice like me to see that the name remains Jesus Christ. But you might be wondering; "What is the name God gave Him which is above every name?" as stated in your claim in Phil2:9....
 It is simple. Just read Heb1. Read the whole chapter. but focus on verses four and five. 
</p>

Heb1:4-5<br />
"Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.<br /> 5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
</p>

So the more excellent name or the name which is above every other name is "Son of God". Its like giving somebody a title. E.g a president is a title, a governor is a title, a headmaster is a title but the title does not change a person's name. E.g the president of Nigeria is a title and the name of the current president is Goodluck Jonathan. Also a pastor is a title and for instance, the pastor of the Household of God church still has his name as Chris Okotie. So you can call him Chris Okotie, Pastor of the Houseehold of God Church.
</p>

In the same vein, Jesus has a title. And that title is "Son of God". So His name and His title reads: "Jesus, the Son of God".
</p>

And please, don't think that because it is a title, He will hand it over when His tenure elapses. No, no, no!!! In that same Hebrews chapter 1, verse 8 reads...<br />
Heb1:8<br />
" But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
</p>

And please do not think that Jesus is just one way and there could be other ways to get to the Father. No. It is very clear.<br />
John14:6<br />
"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
</p>
Also read Acts4:12 <br />
"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>

You also raised another point. The comforter Jesus promised to send John14:16-18<br />
"16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br />
 17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br />
 18 Â¶ I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."<br />
  </p>
  
  You said the comforter is here already, yes. That i agree is true. But you now claimed that comforter is Olumba, no that i disagree. so, who then is the comforter?
  </p>
Check John 14:17<br /> " Even the SPIRIT of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it SEETH HIM NOT, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."
</p>
 
 He is a spirit. You cant see him with your physical eyes. You cannot use your camera to record Him in a video. You cannot take a picture of Him and print on your clothes or books.
</p>

And now, there are many spirits but to know this Comforter, the Spirit of truth, Jesus told us the function of This comforter.
</p>

John14:26 " But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."
</p>

John16:13-14<br /> "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
He shall GLORIFY ME: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you."
</p>

John 15:26<br /> " But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeded from the Father, he shall TESTIFY OF ME:"
</p>
So we can see that his job is to testify of Jesus and to bring Glory to Jesus. So He cant tell you that the name of Jesus has changed or that the title, "son of God" has been transferred". </p>Pause and meditate<br />
